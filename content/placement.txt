Can I get remote freelance work after doing this course?
At LawSikho, we have two types of students: those who already possess good legal skills and those who are in the process of learning. We believe in enabling our learners to start earning from their knowledge without delay.
For students with professional-level legal skills, we offer opportunities in contract drafting, data & privacy, international business law, US immigration law, litigation support, and international IP law work.
However, we understand that acquiring professional-level skills takes time. For those who are still developing their legal skills, we provide alternative work opportunities such as writing articles, conducting research, legal transcription, data entry, law firm administration, social media management, and more. Some students even engage in tasks like voice-over work, data compilation, translation, and virtual assistance.
We have established a dedicated team that actively pitches to organizations in the US to help LawSikho students find remote work.
We have set up a US entity to bridge the trust gap between US legal professionals and an organization operating from India.
We focus on getting learners their first three clients, guiding them in crafting impressive proposals. By the time they secure these initial clients, learners become well-adjusted to the process and can independently attract more clients.
They build their CVs and profiles with real work experience and testimonials, opening doors to numerous opportunities.
Getting started is often the hardest part, but at LawSikho, we make the process frictionless. We have witnessed law students earning well over $1000 per month.
Some students have earned $500 in their first month as a side gig. We have students who, after a year, now earn $10,000 per month. While some may start with $300, they make progress by learning new skills, improving their profiles, and pitching for higher-paying work.
Between April 2021 and June 2023, we created over 21000+ opportunities for our learners, resulting in thousands of students securing freelance work. The total value of work secured amounts to over $3,30,000 (Aprox INR 2.7 Crore). Additionally, hundreds of individuals found employment, and secured internships.
Please note that these numbers represent the initial gigs facilitated directly by us or those on which we actively collaborated with t
