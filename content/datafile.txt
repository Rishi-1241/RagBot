Introduction
Reimagine your career: Beyond traditional law jobs and local legal practice!
This is 2022. The year of re-imagination.
REIMAGINE is the new mantra. Because old ways of thinking and working aren't working any more.
The world has seen the pandemic and has learnt to live with it. People as well as businesses have adapted to it quickly.
In the aftermath of it all, people aren't too excited about going back to the office. They want to work remotely from their home, in the kitchen, in the garden, or at the beach. In fact, virtually from anywhere! Business leaders too, have seen the advantage of hiring people for gig work and projects. It saves them money, speeds up work, and gets them talent from all over the world.
The good news is:
A big opportunity awaits Indian law students, lawyers and legal professionals. You can work as a paralegal, supporting US corporate lawyers.
See, US law firms, Silicon Valley startups and corporate houses are gung-ho about remote legal assistance available to them from all over the world. This gives you an opportunity to work for them, sitting in India, or vacationing in Europe or Africa or wherever!
Do you realise what this means? No need to hustle into a crowd of black coats, no push, no chase. Why do all that when you can have clean, respectful corporate legal work and the opportunity to earn in pure dollars?
Before we get into the details, how can you take advantage of these new trends? Let's take a look at hard facts and prove that these remote work opportunities are indeed what they seem to be.
In the US, currently there are about 57.3 million freelancers.  By 2027, the numbers will increase to 86.5 million! (Upwork)
40% of executives worldwide believe that the percentage of freelance workers will increase over the next five years. 50% believe that corporations will start working and integrating with gig platforms in a significant way. (BCG Henderson)
62% of executives believe that an external workforce helps them improve the financial performance of their company. (SAP Fieldglass)
The common perception is that these kinds of remote jobs are only for IT services. But, there is more to it. All industries are lapping up remote workforce.
Medical documentation is an area where online jobs are booming. At the same time, good content writers are earning so well   If you have what it takes, you could cash in significantly across the globe!
As you are reading this, thousands of individuals are already making US contracts and agreements, researching for law firms and earning high value foreign currency. That too, sitting in their countries-India, Africa, other developing nations, enjoying the comforts of home-cooked food, celebrating local festivals, attending to their parents and kins.
Let us assure you, this is not just a temporary, pandemic created situation.
The remote work trend began much earlier.  Numbers suggest the trend is in full swing since 2012. The pandemic has given it a speed boost and accelerated it to levels unimaginable earlier.
The truth is-
Remote freelance work is just the beginning!
Lawyers and law thinkers are envisioning a system where technology, artificial intelligence and data analysis will make justice accessible and affordable to everyone.
The online legal services are just setting up the scene for the exciting future ahead. Legal thought leaders like Richard Susskind, OBE, the world's most-cited author on the future of legal services, professes-
a future of justice where online courts will be a reality soon.
It is pretty evident that these trends favour remote work. Law students and professionals in India and Africa are losing no time in getting onboard. Those who start early will get a bigger slice out of this pie of opportunity.
A Case In Point:
In India, the entire legal industry is worth less than $2 billion annually. The legal industry size in South Africa is a little over $2.14 billion.
Comparatively, the US legal industry is worth $319.7 billion! The US patent and trademark industry alone is $18 billion. Basically, opportunities are much bigger if you can get into this market now.


The Online Legal Services industry in the US itself is $11.3bn in 2022.
And it will grow by more than 8% every year till 2027, as per estimates.


If you can't see the writing on the wall, here's what it implies-
A huge amount of remote legal work is waiting for Indian and African law students, legal experts and professionals!
We have helped many young lawyers successfully secure US work in domains such as IP, technology and contracts since November 2020.
Now it is time for the corporate law domain.
Here's what we think. We see a huge demand and supply gap here.
When people think about a lawyer, what comes to their mind is a litigation lawyer. The courtrooms.
But, how many corporate lawyers do you know?
Especially if you are in a small town in a developing country, it's difficult to imagine corporate lawyers around you.
Corporate lawyers rarely barge into a courtroom. They are found in the boardrooms of big companies, protect the legal rights of their employers and make sure corporate governance is ensured in those companies. They create and negotiate multi-billion dollar corporate contracts, finalise deals, mergers and acquisitions, as well as joint ventures.
These deals must be documented with unfaltering precision. They must be checked and rechecked. A small turn of phrase can have high value implications.
They need continuous assistance. That's what paralegals do. Couldn’t that be you?
On the other hand, many corporate lawyers work shoulder to shoulder with Silicon Valley founders. These young rising entrepreneurs need to safeguard their own interests;when they deal with top corporations and do technology transfers or make presentations for VC funds, protecting their intellectual property is a top priority. They might be street smart and assertive in their own work, but legal documentation demands legal experts who understand the nitty-gritty of it. A silly mistake can cost them an IPR or a larger amount of equity.
Startups also need corporate lawyers for all kinds of transactional deals, contracts and agreements: incorporation of a company, company structuring, allocation of stocks to co-founders, due diligence before hiring of a senior team member or co-founder.
Additionally, environmental compliance is getting stricter by the day in the US, corporations and startups must update their policies on a regular basis. Or else, fines are steep.
We can go on and on about this because the role of corporate lawyers is all pervasive. From making deals with other business entities to putting a privacy policy on a website or fixing terms of usage of an app, everything needs legal assistance.
But for a large number of US companies and startups, expensive corporate law firms and lawyers are out of reach. That's why they are turning to corporate lawyers and paralegals from India, Africa and other developing countries.
It's your opportunity. There aren't many corporate law brains around,confirm for yourself.
You can kickstart your career in this domain and start dominating it with good results,while others don't even have an inkling of it.

Now let's tackle the real questions that might be lurking in your mind-
Corporate legal work is serious work. Why would Silicon Valley startups and legal firms outsource it to you?
Because, they are smart people.
They want top-notch professional expertise at a low cost.
The US legal experts and Silicon Valley founders have already seen good value in the online assistance that they have received from developing nations. After IP, technology and contract work they are ready to offer bigger responsibilities to capable candidates from these parts of the world.
There is more to it, the US is the most expensive legal market. When they hire a competent US based paralegal, he or she might charge as much as a law firm partner in your country.
Hiring corporate lawyers from Asia and Africa as paralegals is a game changer for US law firms. It gives them a competitive cost advantage.
At the same time, the high conversion ratio of dollars to your local currency is an advantage you cannot overlook. This ratio helps US law firms and corporations get the best legal brains from around the world, for fewer dollars and they also get speed.  When they sleep, their work keeps on happening in another part of the world.
All this happens, while you still earn more in your own currency.
The Domino Effect!
When one US corporate law firm hires online legal freelancers from developing countries, others too, follow suit. Otherwise, they can't match the cost and the pace of work.
By now, enough US firms have adopted this practice to make it the norm pretty soon.  The new normal, as they call it!
Now let's tackle the second, more relevant question -
Can you, with your present level of knowledge, skills and connections, get involved in this huge, remote corporate law work?
We don't want to make you any false promises. It surely needs preparation to be ready for the US legal market. They want only the best.
If you don’t have it right now, do you even stand a chance?
If this question bothers you, you might be at a disadvantage.
But on the brighter side, students with nil or very little work-experience have learnt with us and made money on US assignments.
If they can, you can too.
Whether you are a student, a corporate lawyer or a practising litigation lawyer, the opportunity is open to all.
If you are ready to put in the effort to update your knowledge, to prepare for the skills needed for the US corporate law assignments, you can surely join this new breed of online winners.
We have made it easy for you!
These skills are not difficult to acquire.  The groundwork is already done for you. We have researched the US market, identified the key skills and knowledge which will enable you to kickstart a successful remote legal service career as a corporate paralegal.
Here is the success formula you should use-
Capability (Skills and knowledge) + Track record of delivery + Access to potential employers
= Success in career
First things first, US employers are smart and savvy. They only want to work with people who have the capability to deliver assignments as per their standards. You must have the skills and knowledge required for these tasks if you land the job.
Skills and knowledge, though, are not enough.
The potential recruiter wishes to see some evidence of you doing what you claim to be capable of. That's where your track record comes in to assure them of your capability.
Smart freelancers publish articles, do small freelance work, take pro bono and low-paying assignments and take internships.
Everything that can get you experience and testimonials is valuable.  These initial upvotes, recommendations and references help you shine in an online market. It tells the potential recruiters that you have the experience, that you have proven yourself in the past, that they can rely on you and that you are seriously in the game.
Coming to the third and most important part of this success formula -
Access and Outreach
Those employers don't know you! So, you must be seen in the right places with the right people. That is the only way for them to discover you. You can ensure this by a strong social media presence on the right platforms, becoming part of relevant communities, and networking with professionals who can suggest and recommend your name to them.

Can I get remote freelance work after doing this course?
At LawSikho, we have two types of students: those who already possess good legal skills and those who are in the process of learning. We believe in enabling our learners to start earning from their knowledge without delay.
For students with professional-level legal skills, we offer opportunities in contract drafting, data & privacy, international business law, US immigration law, litigation support, and international IP law work.
However, we understand that acquiring professional-level skills takes time. For those who are still developing their legal skills, we provide alternative work opportunities such as writing articles, conducting research, legal transcription, data entry, law firm administration, social media management, and more. Some students even engage in tasks like voice-over work, data compilation, translation, and virtual assistance.
We have established a dedicated team that actively pitches to organizations in the US to help LawSikho students find remote work.
We have set up a US entity to bridge the trust gap between US legal professionals and an organization operating from India.
We focus on getting learners their first three clients, guiding them in crafting impressive proposals. By the time they secure these initial clients, learners become well-adjusted to the process and can independently attract more clients.
They build their CVs and profiles with real work experience and testimonials, opening doors to numerous opportunities.
Getting started is often the hardest part, but at LawSikho, we make the process frictionless. We have witnessed law students earning well over $1000 per month.
